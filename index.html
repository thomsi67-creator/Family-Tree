        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            This site exists to preserve our family's history - the people, the places,
            the memories, and the stories that connect us across generations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accuracy matters, but so do stories. If you spot something that needs correcting or you'd like to contribute,
            you're very welcome to get involved.
